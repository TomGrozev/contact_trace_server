# ContactTraceServer

This is an assignment I had for uni to implement a COVID contact tracing app. This is the server-side implementation, it is not complex at all, just a simple server.

## Running

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Set the database details in `configs/dev.exs`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
